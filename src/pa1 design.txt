     ALARM CLOCK
     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct thread
  {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /* Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /* Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /* Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /* Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /* Priority. */
    int64_t wakeup_time;            /* Time when a thread should be woken, default = -1 */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /* List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /* List element. */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic;                     /* Detects stack overflow. */
  };

Need a wakeup_time variable to know when that thread should be woken up.
If it is not blocked before, value is -1
When the thread is wokenup, it value is set -1

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

When timer_sleep() is called, it calculates the wakeup time by adding current_t-
ime and sleep_time. This is set as thread.wakeup_time and is blocked.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

all_list is sorted by wakeup_time, So for every timer_interrupt, it is faster t-
o check which threads should be waked

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

Ready_list is sorted by priority and next_thread_to_run function chooses highes-
t thread priority_compare

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------
0

12

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?

>> C6: The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point math in
>> detail, but it leaves it open to you to implement it.  Why did you
>> decide to implement it the way you did?  If you created an
>> abstraction layer for fixed-point math, that is, an abstract data
>> type and/or a set of functions or macros to manipulate fixed-point
>> numbers, why did you do so?  If not, why not?

   SURVEY QUESTIONS
   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
